# shopee_code_league_2020

EVENT BACKGROUND

Shopee Code League is a 2-month online coding challenge consisting of a series of competitions, online algorithm questions and online training workshops open to all 
undergraduate students and professionals across the region (Singapore, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam).

Shopee Code League 2020 operated online entirely from 8 June to 1 August 2020. There were 8 competitions ranging from data analytics, to data science and algorithms, all
of which have been specially designed by Shopee tech teams. Participants must analyse the dataset, draw insightful conclusions and solve the problems in a specified 
amount of time via an online platform.

Special thanks to my team, Team Waterloo, for the opportunity to join the competition.
